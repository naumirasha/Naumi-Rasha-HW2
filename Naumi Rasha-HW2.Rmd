## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
load("~/Documents/brfss22/BRFSS2022/BRFSS2022_rev.RData")

```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
I worked with Chamiqua and Allegra.
```{r}
xtabs(~ brfss22$ADDEPEV3 + brfss22$SEXVAR)
```

```{r}
prop.table(table(brfss22$ADDEPEV3, brfss22$SEXVAR))
```

```{r}
NN <- length(brfss22$ADDEPEV3)
set.seed(12345)
restrict_1 <- (runif(NN) < 0.1) # use just 10% 
summary(restrict_1)
```
```{r}
brfss_small <- subset(brfss22, restrict_1)
```
```{r}
ggplot(brfss_small, aes(x = INCOME3, fill = ADDEPEV3)) + geom_bar()
```
```{r}
ggplot(brfss_small, aes(x = ADDEPEV3, fill = INCOME3)) + geom_bar()
```
```{r}
ggplot(brfss_small, aes(x = INCOME3, fill = ADDEPEV3)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
```{r}
ggplot(brfss_small, aes(x = ADDEPEV3, fill = INCOME3)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
I found this data interesting because I could see how income plays a big part in depression, many people with more income show that they have depression, but the reason behind this could be being able to afford to get help.
